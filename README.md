This is an exercise set used and developed at Stockholm University based on using two fairly simple Energy Balance Models. 

Please download this folder and start by reading the introduction to the exercise set in [Introduction_EBM-lab.pdf](Introduction_EBM-lab.pdf).
You will then find the exercises in the notebook [Exercises_EBM_model.ipynb](Exercises_EBM_model.ipynb)

Good luck! 

This exercise set was originally developed by:
- Ellen Berntell
- Institutionen för naturgeografi och kvartärgeologi
- Stockholms universitet

It has since been translated to English and the code translated to python from matlab by:
