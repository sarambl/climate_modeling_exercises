# climate_modeling_exercises

This is an exercise set used and developed at Stockholm University based on using two fairly simple Energy Balance Models plus analysing CMIP6 models. 

Please download this folder and start by reading the introduction to the exercise set in [01_Introduction_EBM-lab.pdf](01_Introduction_EBM-lab.pdf).
You will then find the exercises in the notebooks [02_Exercises1_and_2_EBM_model.ipynb](02_Exercises1_and_2_EBM_model.ipynb) and [03_Exercises_ESM_modelling.ipynb](03_Exercises_ESM_modelling.ipynb).


Good luck!
