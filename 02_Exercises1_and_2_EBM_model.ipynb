    "**Background**\n",
    "The natural CO$_2$ content has varied approximately between 200 and 280 ppmv during the glacial cycles of the last million years. 280 ppmv is the \"pre-industrial\" level around the end of the 18th century. In the mid-1990s, the concentration was 360 ppmv, which is the default value in the 1-dim model. In May 2013, for the first time in modern times, the level of 400 ppmv was reached and the value of 720 ppmv is a likely level at the end of this century unless strong measures are taken to reduce CO2 emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(ii)** Do the simulated $T_m$ values of 200 and 280 ppmv agree with our knowledge of global temperature variations during glacial cycles? If not, suggest **one or more reasons** why the simulated temperature changes may be too large or too small. Are there important processes not represented in this model?\n",
    "- **(iii)** Use the values in the table to calculate the climate sensitivity of the model, i.e. the global mean temperature change when the CO$_2$ content doubles. Explain clearly how you estimate this value from the simulations. Do you obtain a unique value for climate sensitivity, or does it depend on the reference CO$_2$ level or climate state? If so, why?\n"
